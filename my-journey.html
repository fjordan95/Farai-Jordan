    <h1>How I became a "software person"</h1>
    <p>There was a time when, like many people, I thought software development, or data management, 
        or really anything that wasn't analog, was beyond my abilities. I thought "computers are interesting,
        but they are far too complex for me." Then, I saw basic HTML on social media one day in high 
        school and decided maybe it was possible. . . and then simply let the interest pass. Then, when 
        I was at my reception job in college, my boss decided that I looked bored and asked me to go through 
        all the dead links in our department website. That was even more interesting. At that time, I kept a 
        notebook in my bag where I would study computer networks and their historical development when I 
        finished with my other homework. I still didn't see *computers* as a viable career path. I already 
        had a career. I was going to teach. Like my mother, and my grandmother, and my aunt, any my great uncle. 
        And I enjoyed teaching at the time so I didn't see a reason to abandon that career path. Then, I became 
        a teacher. I lasted maybe three years and I was burnt out beyond belief. I had quit my job and was doing 
        gig work to pay my bills. It was miserable and I decided that I needed a new career path. Every time I 
        got on google to aimlessly search for new career options, I was met with the same meaningless options. 
        "Go be a nurse, the pay is fantastic!" "Work in sales, anyone can do it!" "Get your Google Certifications 
        and become a software developer!" All advertisements aimed at people who don't know what they want and might 
        be willing to spend some money on the training to try it out. But, the idea stuck with me and I know a 
        software developer. He makes way more money than I do. So I asked him, "How realistic are those ads? 
        Can I really just "get google certifications" and turn it into a job?" The answer was much more in depth
        than I thought it would be. To summarize our long and largely unserious conversation, it was absolutely
        possible for me to teach myself to code and then turn that skill into a job. He suggested I 
        check out the OKCoders boot camp and put me in touch with a community of programmers that became 
        integral to my life within 6 months. Unfortunately, the boot camp had closed its application period 
        and it wouldn't be open for another year. I didn't want to wait a year. I went home that night 
        and searched for free coding courses because I wanted to start immediately. The longer I treaded 
        that path, the more I realized that I not only had and interest and feel for coding, but that 
        I had also chosen the path that was meant for me. I love learning but I was bogged down by three jobs
        when I first started. I didn't have the free time or money to invest in a boot camp. So I used what 
        I already knew about guiding learning pathways to structure a learning path for myself. I learned HTML 
        first and that was a walk in the park. Then, I tackled CSS and while there's absolutely no way to learn 
        all there is to learn, I got a handle on it. I learned how to navigate stack overflow and how to 
        avoid answers that were. . . unhelpful. Then, I started working on Javascript. The lesson I learned 
        there was how to be wrong. And then how to keep pushing until it's right. At this point, I decided it
        was time to reach out for some outside help. I knew I would benefit from some external guidance. So, 
        I sent a message to a mentorship coordinator in my local coders group and was matched with someone I had 
        already met. She helped me solve some of my technical problems and fill in gaps that I didn't know I had 
        in my knowledge at the time. Then, when I needed a new job, she helped me put my learning on hold so 
        I could find a job that allowed me the space to grow as a coder. For a few months, that was enough.
        Then, I got restless again. I was still learning, but I felt I could be learning more. I started 
        carving out time to go to any event I could find and most of the information was above my understanding 
        but I met people. One day, I went to a lightning talk and the speaker was hilarious. I sat there 
        listening and said, "I want to be friends with her." So, after the meeting, I struck up a conversation.
        We discussed my path up until that point and my goals and other hobbies we had. When I expressed 
        that I felt like I was doing okay on my own but I wanted more from my learning, she offered to put 
        me in touch with a volunteer group that maintains an active website and I could join them in a 
        sort of internship capacity if I wanted. So I applied and I was asked to go to a volunteer meeting 
        that had nothing to do with web development and maintenance and I almost left. But as soon as the
        meeting was over, my new friend turned to me and said "Ok now let's go find the director of IT." 
        And so began my "internship." I was incredibly surprised at how quickly I was able to begin 
        picking things up here. We were looking at code more complex than anything I'd ever had my hands 
        on before and there were times when I felt the discussion was simply above my skill set. But I stuck
        it out. Googling every term and concept that seems familiar or within my grasp until I felt 
        comfortable interjecting to ask my questions. Then the director began to put me on the spot and 
        ask me if I understood this or could explain that and I began to understand computers in a new 
        way once again. At that time, I was struggling to carve out time for self-driven learning, but a 
        commitment to go to this meeting and pair program for 8 hours every weekend pushed me through. 
        I felt like no matter how much time I had during the week to work on personal projects and 
        assignments, I would always have a dedicated time when I would be learning on real code under the 
        supervision of someone who had been coding for more than 20 years. It was exactly what I needed. As of 
        today, I don't feel like I'm ready for a job. But I don't know that I will ever feel ready. There will
        always be something new for me to learn. Some new trick to execute, some new idea my friend had. 
        And I will always want to work out the mechanics so I can learn something new.</p>
